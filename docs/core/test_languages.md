## Tai Tham Sample Paragraph

<p>
For centuries throughout the northern regions of Southeast Asia in
the Xishuangbanna (<span lang="zh-Hans">西双版纳</span> 
<span lang="th">สิบสองปันนา</span>) region of Yunnan in China,
in the Lanna (<span lang="th">ล้านนา</span>) region of Northern Thailand, 
in the Shan state (<span lang="th">รัฐฉาน</span>) of Myanmar around the city of 
Kengtung (<span lang="th">เชียงตุง</span>) and in Laos, the
Tai Tham script (<span lang="th">อักษรธรรมล้านนา หรือ ตั๋วเมือง</span>) has been used
extensively to preserve important religious and cultural texts. In
Buddhist monastaries throughout the region, texts in Sanskrit, Pali, and
local Tai (<span lang="zh-Hans">傣</span> <span lang="th">ไท</span>) languages were 
traditionally written on palm leaf manuscripts (<span lang="zh-Hans">贝叶经</span> 
<span lang="th">คัมภีร์ใบลาน</span>) or folded sa paper (<span lang="th">พับสา</span>).
